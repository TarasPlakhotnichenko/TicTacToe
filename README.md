# TicTacToe
My first java  full blown program  - android Tic-tac-toe. 
I've  gone through from a "know nothing" about Java and android development  a month ago to this stage.
It's done in a vision on this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT9jqwrlVyQ 

PS This is deprecated  move on  to a fresh version of TicTacToe rewritten from scratch: https://github.com/TarasPlakhotnichenko/TicTacToe3
